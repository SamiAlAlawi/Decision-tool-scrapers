# Decision-tool-scrapers

There are two scripts that when run gather data on courses for the IHE. This is achieved through web scraping. To run the scripts, just type:
1) *python3 webscraper.py*
2) *python3 graduateWebscraper.py*

This will output two csv files with the required information.

**Note that this is a modified version of the actual web scraper run - In the interest of time, the number of courses to be scraped has been cut down**
